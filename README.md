# Spending Habits Data Project
## Introduction
In this project, I use python to explore and understand the spending habits of the people in India. The goal is to try and understand how the people there spend across the different ages, times and the different categories available to spend on.

## Purpose
This analysis is centred on trying to see whether there are any observable differences for people in India through, as mentioned, the different ages, times, and different spending categories.

The dataset in this analysis has been gotten from Kaggle and has been simulated to data on the spending habits of the people there.
